# NEXUS Project Manifest

## Vision Statement

NEXUS is a **Labor Multiplier** for Alberta K-12 teachers, NOT a teacher replacement.

## Core Mission: Capacity Recovery

- Address the "Capacity Crisis" in Alberta classrooms
- Support EAL (English as Additional Language) students with 15+ minutes daily oracy practice
- Reduce teacher administrative burden through automated "Scout Reports"
- Bridge cultural contexts to Alberta curriculum

## Key Principles

1. **Privacy-First**: Audio-only, no video/biometrics, FOIP compliant
2. **Teacher Authority**: All insights are drafts; teachers retain 100% grading authority
3. **Vendor Agnostic**: Interchangeable LLM backends to prevent lock-in
4. **Alberta-Specific**: Curriculum aligned to Alberta Program of Studies

## Target Outcomes

- 8-12 percentage point improvement in EAL students meeting PAT Literacy benchmarks
- 5+ hour weekly reduction in teacher administrative workload
- 15+ minutes daily English conversation practice per EAL student

## Phase Roadmap

- **Phase 1**: Oracy Engine + Scout Reports (Pilot)
- **Phase 2**: Intelligent Differentiation / Cultural Bridge (Month 9)
- **Phase 3**: Affective Guardrails - Opt-in only (Year 2)
